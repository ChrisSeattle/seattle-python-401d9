## Project Ideas:
- RaspberryPis
    - Games
    - Facial recognition
- Middle ware for a search engine
- Password manager
- Games:
    - The idea is to create a web scraper that gathers data, and the game is to point it at a certain dataset, and try to get a high score of data scraped.
    - Feed a Python    
- Alexa Skills
- Build a web scraper that finds apartments/places to live within an area
- Apps that use APIs:
    - This is the youtube API, which looks cool:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_API
    - This big data API also looks cool:
    - https://www.intellexer.com/intellexer_api.html 
- CRUD Apps:
    - Crisis Connections Logger
    - Recipe Maker
    - Fun crafted item
        - Finding out what materials we have on hand to make an item. By item, more like something crafted together. Like nickel and wood make a crude knife. Or a net and wood make a bug catcher.
